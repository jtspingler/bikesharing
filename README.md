Tableau

## Overview
In this project we analyzed Citibike data in NYC in order to understand our customers and trends over time.

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise was to practice slicing data in many different ways and most importantly, vizualizing it in Tableau. From these results ideally we would be able to propose a business plan for the Des Moines Citibike expansion.
